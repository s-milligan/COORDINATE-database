To simplify the search, the survey\r\nnames are highlighted with links to surveys’ documentation entry pages\r\nif possible.\r\n… The harmonisation pages\r\nHarmonisation can be a useful method for researchers who wish to\r\ncompile similar measures collected by separate studies.

Since\r\nthere is little prior knowledge on comparative measurements for the\r\nwell-being of children and young people, micro-data from a number of key\r\nchild well-being surveys in Europe have been prepared for comparative\r\nanalysis by a carefully conducted and documented ex-post harmonization\r\nprocess and the outcomes examined thoroughly for their performance in\r\nterms of measurement equivalence (where possible), and possible losses\r\nof reliability and validity as compared to the source data. This will\r\nincrease the understanding of the relative (dis-) advantages of\r\nparticular, alternative forms of measuring the same concepts in the\r\ncomparative setting. Below we provide guidelines for conducting the\r\nharmonization on the key variables using\r\nR .\r\nThe harmonization work flow is fairly straightforward as shown in the\r\nfigure below. For each concept we wish to harmonize, we gather the\r\nrelevant variable from the available datasets, map the values together,\r\nand then aggregate them into a harmonized vector including individual\r\ncase identifiers so that multiple harmonized variables can be joined\r\ntogether and analyzed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Harmonization work flow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Children’s states of mental health determine how well\r\nthey can manage the different kinds of emotions, affects and feelings\r\nthat life events arouse, which at times can be intense and varied in\r\nnature. One way to measure mental health is to ask about subjective life\r\nevaluations, i.e. how happy one thinks he or she is, and how one feels\r\nabout him or herself and life in general. This is usually possible from\r\nmiddle childhood onwards. Then it is common to ask children how they are\r\nfeeling at a particular point in time i.e. core affect. This type of\r\nfeeling varies over time and does not have a beginning nor an end, and\r\nmay not necessarily be directed at anything. Often it can be feeling\r\nhappy, or relaxed, or satisfied, or in a calm state or full of\r\nenergy.\r\nHappiness\r\n\r\nBritish Household Panel Survey (BHPS)\r\nQuestion text\r\nWhich best describes how you feel about your life as a whole?\r\nMeasurement\r\nOrdinal\r\nPerspective\r\nYouth\r\nAge range\r\n11 to 15\r\nGeographical coverage\r\nEngland, Scotland and Wales\r\nSurvey design\r\nPanel\r\nTime span\r\n1994 – 2008\r\n\r\nUK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS)\r\nQuestion text\r\nWhich best describes how you feel about life as a whole\r\nMeasurement\r\nOrdinal\r\nPerspective\r\nYouth\r\nAge range\r\n10 to 15\r\nGeographical coverage\r\nEngland, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland\r\nSurvey design\r\nPanel\r\nTime span\r\n2009 – 2018\r\n\r\nChildren’s Worlds (ISCWeB)\r\nQuestion text\r\nHow happy you feel with your life as a whole?\r\nMeasurement\r\nOrdinal\r\nPerspective\r\nYouth\r\nAge range\r\n8\r\nGeographical coverage\r\nAlgeria, Brazil, Canada, Chile, England, Israel, Nepal, Romania,\r\nRwanda, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Uganda and the US\r\nSurvey design\r\nRepeated Cross-Sectional\r\nTime span\r\n2011-2012 – 2016-2019\r\n\r\nMillenium Cohort Study (MCS)\r\nQuestion text\r\nPlease give your answers on the basis of [^Cohort child’s name]’s\r\nbehaviour over the last six months.
