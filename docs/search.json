(Link to Excel spreadsheet).\r\nFor the most detailed level of information, the original survey\r\ndocumentation should be consulted. To simplify the search, the survey\r\nnames are highlighted with links to surveys’ documentation entry pages\r\nif possible.\r\n… the harmonisation pages\r\nHarmonisation can be a useful method for researchers who wish to\r\ncompile similar measures collected by separate studies. In the\r\nharmonisation pages of this database,\r\nwe provide instruction for retrospective (ex-post) harmonisation of\r\nexisting data sources in a selection of the core child wellbeing\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nThere has been an increasing number of child well-being surveys at\r\nnational and cross-European levels. From a research point of view, the\r\nvalue of such data increases dramatically if the data originally\r\ncollected for national research become available for truly comparative\r\nanalyses. On these pages, we list the relevant datasets and provide\r\ndescriptions of the datasets and variables that are available for\r\nresearchers and policy makers who wish to better understand child\r\nwellbeing.\r\nBeyond the provision of information on variables, we have been\r\nworking on the harmonisation of individual variables. Under the\r\nHarmonisation tab we provide a detailed\r\nguide through the harmonisation process using the freely available\r\nstatistical software R.\r\nResearchers have taken various approaches to categorize child\r\nwellbeing measures, often depending upon the focus of the research.\r\nBroadly, most frameworks are developed to make or inform policy-oriented\r\nrecommendations for children and families or to better understand the\r\nunderlying causes and consequences of child wellbeing (Pollock et al. 2018).\r\nWe have organized related measures into categories based on a\r\nframework developed by the OECD. This framework takes a holistic\r\napproach designed to aid evidence-based policy development. They trace\r\nmeasures in outcomes (material, physical health, social, emotional,\r\ncultural, cognitive, and educational) children’s activities,\r\nrelationships, and behaviours (family, health, social, leisure, civil,\r\nlearning, and digital), children’s settings and environments (family,\r\nhome, school, community), and public policy conditions (family, housing,\r\nhealth, educational and environmental policies). These are adapted by\r\nSchölmerich and his colleagues (Schölmerich, Agache, and Leyendecker\r\n2015) into the following categories which we use to organize\r\nthe measurement items:\r\n Material wellbeing\r\n Education  Health and safety\r\n Family and environment\r\n Risk behaviour and lifestyle\r\n Subjective\r\nwellbeing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPollock, Gary, Jessica Ozan, Haridhan Goswami, Gwyther Rees, and Anita\r\nStasulane. 2018.

Children’s states of mental health determine how well\r\nthey can manage the different kinds of emotions, affects and feelings\r\nthat life events arouse, which at times can be intense and varied in\r\nnature. One way to measure mental health is to ask about subjective life\r\nevaluations, i.e. how happy one thinks he or she is, and how one feels\r\nabout him or herself and life in general. This is usually possible from\r\nmiddle childhood onwards. Then it is common to ask children how they are\r\nfeeling at a particular point in time i.e. core affect. This type of\r\nfeeling varies over time and does not have a beginning nor an end, and\r\nmay not necessarily be directed at anything. Often it can be feeling\r\nhappy, or relaxed, or satisfied, or in a calm state or full of\r\nenergy.\r\nHappiness\r\nBritish Household Panel Study (BHPS) Link: to\r\nhomepage\r\nQuestion text\r\nWhich best describes how you feel about your life as a whole?\r\nMeasurement\r\nOrdinal\r\nPerspective\r\nYouth\r\nAge range\r\n11 to 15\r\nTime span\r\n1994 – 2008\r\nUnderstanding Society (US)\r\nQuestion text\r\nWhich best describes how you feel about life as a whole\r\nMeasurement\r\nOrdinal\r\nPerspective\r\nYouth\r\nAge range\r\n10 to 15\r\nTime span\r\n2009 – 2018\r\nChildren`s World (ISCWeB)\r\nQuestion text\r\nHow happy you feel with your life as a whole?\r\nMeasurement\r\nOrdinal\r\nPerspective\r\nYouth\r\nAge range\r\n8 – 12\r\nTime span\r\n2011-2012 – 2016-2019\r\nMillenium Cohort Study (MCS)\r\nQuestion text\r\nPlease give your answers on the basis of [^Cohort child’s name]’s\r\nbehaviour over the last six months.
